/*
JavaScript strict mode is a way to opt-in to a "restricted" variant of JavaScript, which disallows certain 
features that are not recommended or compatible with modern JavaScript. When strict mode is enabled, the JavaScript
interpreter will be more strict in interpreting the code, and will throw errors for certain actions that would 
otherwise be allowed. Examples of features that are disallowed in strict mode include using a variable without 
declaring it, and using a non-writable property.
