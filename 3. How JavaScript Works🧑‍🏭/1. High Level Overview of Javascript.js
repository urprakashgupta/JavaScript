The lecture covers the following key topics:

1. JavaScript Overview: JavaScript is high-level, meaning it abstracts away hardware details like memory management, unlike low-level languages like C. JavaScript manages memory automatically using garbage collection, which clears unused data.

2. Interpreted and Compiled: JavaScript is both interpreted and just-in-time compiled, translating human-readable code into machine code (binary) in real-time.

3. Multi-Paradigm Language: JavaScript supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. This flexibility allows developers to choose their preferred coding style, which will be explored in the course.

4. Object-Oriented Nature: JavaScript is prototype-based, meaning objects are created using prototypes rather than traditional classes. Arrays, for example, inherit methods from a prototype.

5. First-Class Functions: JavaScript treats functions as variables, allowing them to be passed as arguments or returned from other functions, which enables powerful coding techniques and functional programming.

6. Dynamic Language: JavaScript is dynamic, meaning variable types are determined at runtime, adding flexibility but requiring developers to be mindful of type handling.
